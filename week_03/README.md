## Week 3

This week, we discussed the work of different data visualization theorists - Stephen Few, Edward Tufte, and Alberto Cairo. 

We also learned how to create bar charts and display them using d3js. I was able to create a chart showing the different library branches and the numbers of visits they've seen. It's been fun to see the interaction of .html and .js and update my visuals online as I'm editing my code! :nerd_face:
