## Week 3

This week, we discussed the work of different data visualization theorists - Stephen Few, Edward Tufte, and Alberto Cairo. 

We also learned how to create bar charts and display them using d3js. I was able to create a chart showing the different library branches and the numbers of visits they've seen. It's been fun to see the interaction of .html and .js and update my visuals online as I'm editing my code! :nerd_face:

### Final Project Data - Spotify Data!:notes:
Data Source: 
* Title: Spotify Songs
* This data comes from Spotify via the spotifyr package. Charlie Thompson, Josiah Parry, Donal Phipps, and Tom Wolff authored this package to make it easier to get either your own data or general metadata arounds songs from Spotify's API.
* Link: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md

Description of Data: <br />
This data contains basic information on different songs ranging from title, artist, albumn, date of release, etc., but also contains calculated measures such as danceability, energy, key, loudness, liveness, instrumentalness, etc. 

Why you are interested in this topic: <br />
I am interested in this topic because I have always been curious about how Spotify calculates and organizes their music algorithmically. The data provided may confirm what I know about different songs or artists, but also teach me something new about how they sort music. 

Thoughts on how you would hope to use this data / potential data points: <br />
I would like to use columns such as danceability, liveness, acousticness combined with date of release to be able to visualize popular music and their genre/vibe throughout the decades. I will then be able to create histograms or scatter plots with density of the point corresponding to either the average popularity or quantity of a certain genre throughout different decades. 

Any concerns about the data: <br />
The data comes directly from Spotify, so I am overall confident. However, they way they calculate columns like danceability and liveness could be less than perfect, and I would have to keep that in mind as I create visualizations.

Identify if source is primary or secondary: <br />
primary
