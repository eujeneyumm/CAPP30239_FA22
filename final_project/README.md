## <a href="https://eujeneyumm.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/final_project"> Why Don't Americans Vote? </a>

Voting plays a pivotal role in upholding democracy in the United States, but 35 - 60% of eligible voters do not vote in a given election. In this project, I investigate the current state of voting patterns and the physical and mental barriers that citizens may be facing that prevents them from going to the polls. The data is in the form of 5,836 surveys from <a href = "https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/non-voters">FiveThirtyEight</a> (polling done by Ipsos) conducted in September 2020.
