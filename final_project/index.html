    <p class="divider gradient"></p>

    <p>Voting plays a pivotal role in upholding democracy in the United States, but 35 - 60% of eligible voters do not vote in a given election.  Especially with recent events, many people are understandably disillusioned and discouraged. It is important to extract the causes underlying this behavior in order to combat dwindling interest in civic duties and boost voter turnout. In this article, I will investigate the current state of voting patterns and the physical, situational, and mental barriers that citizens may be facing that prevents them from going to the polls. The data is in the form of 5,836 surveys from FiveThirtyEight (polling done by Ipsos) conducted in September 2020.</p>

    <p class="divider gradient"></p>
    <p>Looking at the breakdown of demographic information and voting behavior, we can see that nonvoters were more likely to have lower incomes, be young, and have lower levels of education. These are all result that align with what we know about people that are less likely to engage with the political system. However, one can observe that those who sometimes vote and always vote are actaully not all that different across demographic breakdowns.</p>

    <p class="divider gradient"></p>
    <p> Of the three groups of voters we identified, those voters who only vote some of the time were actually the likeliest to report having stood in line for more than an hour; they were also likelier than those who vote more regularly to say they couldn’t get off work to vote.</p>

    <p class="divider gradient"></p>
    <p>I went through many iterations of topics before deciding to focus on voting behavior in America and the potential roadblocks behind getting to the polls. I used survey data from FiveThirtyEight (polling done by Ipsos) conducted in September 2020. It has 5,836 respondents and their voting behavior (our labels), which can be characterized as always, sporadic, or rarely/never. The survey asks 110 questions targeting the respondent’s political leanings, sentiment toward the efficacy of government, whether they receive benefits from government programs, and the impact that Covid has had on their lives. </p>
    <p>The dataset itself was not difficult to digest, but a lot of data cleaning had to be done in order to prepare the data correctly for my visuals. First, I had to break up the “voter” column that has three types of values - always, sporadic, or rarely/never – into three separate columns in order to create the bar graph that breaks down voter behavior via demographic (series of bar charts). I followed a similar process for the parallel graph, where I renamed a lot of the columns from names like “Q18_1” to explicit statements like “was told they did not have the correct identification” so that the visualization was more understandable. The tree map in the bottom of the article was a little tricky to tackle at first, but required very few data points. Therefore, I created a json data file to feed into my tree map with information on registration status, party, and voting behavior. </p>
    <p>Why did you choose the charts you chose?
      TO BE FILLED
    </p>
    <p>One of the biggest limitations when it came to choosing chart types to tell the story I wanted to was the fact that my data surveyed people at one point in time. This meant that any form of time series was impossible and limited my choices when it came to choosing a type of chart to best explain the story. It took some time to break out the mentality that bar graphs were the easiest for the reader to understand the situation, especially since the partial goal of this project was to expose myself to different types of data visualizations. Some other limitations include time and the reality that we did only have nine weeks of exposure to d3js and some of the loftier goals that I had in mind probably required a bit more expertise and time to complete. </p>
